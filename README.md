# ANNA: A Deep Learning-Based Dataset in Heterogeneous Traffic for Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview
This repository hosts the ANNA dataset, a comprehensive collection of images from Bangladeshi traffic, tailored for training and testing autonomous vehicle systems in heterogeneous traffic environments.

## Dataset Description
- **Link**: The dataset is available in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1girVtUfxkRpYMgnl4WEAfhNBHPJPFk6h?usp=sharing).
- **Structure**: Organized following the YOLOv5 folder structure.
- **Size**: Comprises 1800 images.
- **Classes**: Includes the following vehicle classes: cars, buses, rickshaws, bikes, CNGs, bicycles, easybikes, and vans.

## Resources
- **Trained Model**: The trained model is available in [this link](https://github.com/MahediKamal/ANNA-A-Deep-Learning-Based-Dataset-in-Heterogenous-Traffic-for-Autonomous-Vehicles/blob/f550bbf0147270b9e6a2f5fdd6652feed7688562/trained%20model/best_multiple_object(v2).pt).
- **Demo Video**: Demonstrates object detection on Bangladeshi roads.
